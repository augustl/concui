# concui

This project is abandoned. See the previous commit for the code. The code isn't really that interesting though, it's just a couple of hundred lines of a pretty lame experiment using the STM that wouldn't go anywhere. Most of the time was spent figuring out OpenGL.

It has been superseded by https://github.com/augustl/halt/, an operating system (why stop at the UI?).
