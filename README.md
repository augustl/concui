Truly concurrent UI framework, completely free of mutable values.

Very much a work in progress. See the introductory blog post, http://augustl.com/blog/2013/truly_concurrent_user_interfaces/

NOTE: Just because I haven't commited in a while doesn't mean I've abandoned the project :) I plan to continue hacking on this, I just haven't had time the last couple of months.
